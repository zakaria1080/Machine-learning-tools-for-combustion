# Machine learning tools to improve combustion
Machine learning is more and more used and helps to extract new informations or see new patterns/relations between datas. This project uses the unsupervised learning to explore the behavior 
of combustion for different fuels. This repository will be used to get an overview and after that improve combustion to reduce NOx pollutants.
